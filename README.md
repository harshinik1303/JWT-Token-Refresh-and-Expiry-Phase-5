#JWT Token Refresh and Expiry


##1.Aim:


   The aim of the JWT Token Refresh and Expiry project is to implement secure user authentication by using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that automatically expire after a set time and can be renewed using refresh tokens — ensuring both security and smooth user experience.
##2.Features:


   User Login and Signup – Users can register and log in securely.
   Access Token Creation – A token is generated after login.
   Token Expiry – Access token expires after a short time for safety.
   Refresh Token – Used to get a new access token without logging in again.
   Logout Option – Users can log out and remove tokens.
   Secure Authentication – Passwords are encrypted, and tokens are verified.
   Error Handling – Shows proper messages for invalid or expired tokens.
##3.Technologies:


   ###Frontend (Optional – if included)
     HTML / CSS / JavaScript – For creating a simple UI (login & signup forms).
     React.js (optional) – For building a dynamic, responsive frontend interface.
  ###Backend
     Node.js – JavaScript runtime for building the backend server.
     Express.js – Framework for handling routes, middleware, and API requests easily.
  ###Authentication & Security
     JWT (JSON Web Token) – For secure authentication, access token creation, and refresh token handling.
     bcrypt.js – For password hashing and encryption before storing in the database
     dotenv – For managing environment variables securely (like secret keys).
     cookie-parser / cors – For managing cookies and cross-origin requests securely.
  ###Database
     MongoDB – To store user details and refresh tokens.
     Mongoose – ODM library to connect and interact with MongoDB easily.
